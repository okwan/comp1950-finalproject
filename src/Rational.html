		 <h3>	General </h3>
		</section>
       <section>
	<p>	Here is the list of all technologies we have deployed in our project: </p>

	 <ul class="a">
   	     <li>	Begin with HTML 5 because to be more updated with most of browsers and gain more tools via it </li>
 	     <li>	Semantic coding style: To let browsers and SEO and screen readers to be able to read our page easier </li>
 	     <li> 	 Embedded and Inline styles: 	We deploy embedded style to modify small changes and for big files we deploy Inline styles to keep our code more clean and organize   </li>
 	     <li> 	Deploy CSS selectors like name, id and â€¦ to allow be more specific for each part of our codes</li>
 	     <li> 	CSS Measurement: most of the time we deploy % as a css measurement to be compatible with different size of screens instead of px or pt which are fixed and be able to have somehow a responsive screen</li>
 	     <li> 	CSS Reset: To be able to manipulate with CSS  and minimize odd behavior in rendering and to able to create custom rule for CMS </li>
 	     <li> 	Navigation List: easy to use this method and brings new features and helps to simplify code and layouts </li>
 	     <li> 	jQuery: to access any DOM easily, less code writing, very compatible and powerful library </li>
 	     <li>	To help SEO to search our page we deploy these techniques:
	Semantic Codes, Page Title, URL structure , contextual linking
</li>
 	      <li> Precode environment (Rainbow.js)to have a nice and elegant code style </li> 
 	 </ul>

           <br>
	    
		 <h3>Home Page</h3><br>
		
          <ul class="a">
   	     <li>	Text-shadow to give more advance look and nice features  </li>
        <li> jQuery id selector to have a powerful easy tool to address CSS  </li>
   	     </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Lectures</h3><br>
          <ul class="a">
		   	  <li>seperate navigation for exercises to easily find which exercise you want to redo</li>
		      <li>build on a one-page veritical design, this was becasue when using the bcitcomp.ca site, it felt like a lot of information was thrown at you on one page.</li>
		      <li>navigation on top makes a more modern approach to a side navigation. Fixed top navigation insures that navigation always exists. In current site, you will always have to scroll all the way back up in order to locate the navigation</li>
		      <li>navigation uses css3 features by doing full screen overlays and fixed/float positioning</li>
		      <li>modern choice of font to increase readability, DIN Pro Font Family, and Sanchez</li>
		      <li>using prism.js framework to make code snippets more appealing, with sytnax highlighting</li>
		      <li>increase hierachy of overall design for readability and enhance user experience</li>
		      <li>exercises are now not just hyperlinks inside the lecture page, but will be turned into buttons for better usabiliity.</li>
   	     </ul>
   	     <br><br><br>
   	     <h3>Layout Decisions</h3><br>
   	     <p>The most obvious improvement we have done is the overall UI enhancements. We provided a seamless color scheme, even adding text-highlighting color. The text on the current website becomes blurry and hard to read when you stare at it for a long time because of it's tight and small font. We wanted to make sure that the user does not get overwhelmed by information but focus on what they want to look at instead.</p><br>
   	     <p>The biggest problems on the current website is that it can get overwhelming with all the info. It was also very troublesome to scroll through to access certain links. We strongly believe in the one-page vertical design still which was similiar to the current website. But we added better functionality by incorporating smooth scrolling to different exercises on the lecture page. Also, to access the homework, all you need to do is to click the floating nav button and click on the homework button to download it.</p><br><p>Listed above are all the deliverables that we implemented. The most advanced jQuery / CSS3 functions were the full screen overlays and smooth scrolling. With the powerful library of jQuery, it was quite easy to add / remove classes to do the overlay feature of opening and closing. We did take advantage of open-source libraries available such as animate, headroom, and prism.</p><br><p>Headroom was used to implement the scrolling nav feature, so the top navigation will be hidden when the user scrolls. This helps with overall usability and only show the navigation when the user really needs it. We implemented this because we believe the content is the most important thing that the user needs to be looking for.</p>
   	     <br><h3>Plan To Implemenate</h3><br>
   	     <p>Some things we would like to implemenate is to personalise the website according to the user. The user would be able to log-in through a server/client interaction within the website. There the student can access grades, exercise solutions, quiz answers and so on. Therefore everything will be based off the website, and the course could have an option of becoming an online course as well.</p>
