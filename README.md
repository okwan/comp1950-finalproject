# COMP1950 Final Project
UI Design Concept

- seperate navigation for exercises to easily find which exercise you want to redo
- build on a one-page veritical design, this was becasue when using the bcitcomp.ca site, it felt like a lot of information was thrown at you on one page.
- navigation on top makes a more modern approach to a side navigation.
- navigation uses css3 features by doing full screen overlays and fixed/float positioning
- modern choice of font to increase readability, Roboto Font Family, Alba Slab for Headers
- using prism.js framework to make code snippets more appealing, with sytnax highlighting
- increase hierachy of overall design for readability and enhance user experience
